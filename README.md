# TV Land ActiveRecord Associations Lab

## Objectives
1. Creating and modifying tables using ActiveRecord
2. Writing associations between models


## spec/actor_spec.rb

1. Build out the schema for the actors and characters table.
2. Actors should have a `first_name` and a `last_name`.
3. Characters should have a `name` and a `show_id`.
4. Associate the Actor model with the Character and Show model. Do any of the models need a foreign key?
5. Write the two methods `full_name` and `list_roles` that the spec requires. Write any helper methods that you need.

## spec/character_spec.rb

1. Add the column `catchphrase` to your character model.
2. Define the method `say_that_thing_you_say` and make the spec pass.

## spec/show_spec.rb

1. Create the neccesary associations between shows, networks, and characters.
2. Add all the attributes to the Show model that the spec requires.
